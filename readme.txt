The main risk with using an online website are technical issues. These aren't uncommon, and can have major impacts on the business itself. Say a restaurant is using our booking system, but there's a problem which stops users from entering input or finishing the order. This can greatly reduce business, as the percentage of people that prefer to use an online website will not be able to book in. The business may not be aware of this problem for a period of time, only coming accross it by chance or getting a note from users will alert them.


Benefits:
Quicker and faster booking system
Being able to do it anywhere with internet
Increase customer count for businesses

Dependencies:
- To start our first wireframe designs, we need some basic planning done so we have something to go off. This could be keeping the homepage simple with only a small sentence and a button. Also choosing user inputs, the theme of the page, and navigation.
- Development depends on high fidelity designs. This lets us know exactly how the website will look, with the background, text, and buttons. The reason this is dependent is because it's a lot more work to make changes in HTML than PowerPoint, so knowing what we're doing will help.
