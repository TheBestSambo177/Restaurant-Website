Project Charter:
We chose this website as the current ones are lacking in user interface and don't offer you much options apart from calling in the company.
Our website will also account for the amount of food making sure that there will be enough before going to the restraunt.

Objectives:
- Good ui
- Easy to navigate
- Visually appealing
- Recongition over recall
These are the 4 main things that we want our website to include, and they all sort of work together to create a better user experience. The most important would be a good UI, as all the others rely on it. This can mean that it isn't too cluttered, or difficult to read, or confusing on what to do next. This needs to be prioritized over being visual appealing, although that is an aspect of good UI. There's no point in making your website look good if it doesn't do what it's supposed to. Recognition over recall is another aspect of UI, and could mean how easy the website is to understand. Users should immediately know what to do upon looking at a website, and not have to remember from their previous experiences with it. This can be achieved by using universal features, such as the logo acting as a home button.

Constraits:
- Not making it too cluttured 
- Contrast, making sure the images and text work well with each other.

Main stakeholders:
- Samuel Kennedy 50%
- Javarn Tromp de Haas 50%

Risks:
- Errors like buttons not working
- Hackers
- Been outdated
- Accessability
The main risk with using an online website are technical issues. These aren't uncommon, and can have major impacts on the business itself. Say a restaurant is using our booking system, but there's a problem which stops users from entering input or finishing the order. This can greatly reduce business, as the percentage of people that prefer to use an online website will not be able to book in. The business may not be aware of this problem for a period of time, only coming accross it by chance or getting a note from users will alert them.


Benefits:
- Quicker and faster booking system
- Being able to do it anywhere with internet
- Increase customer count for businesses
This website will make it easier for customers to book, which will in turn benefit the business. Booking online is a lot more convinent that through a phone call, and a lot more people could be willing to book if the process is simpler.

General overview:
The website will be three pages one being the home page, and information page, Checkoutpage
It will be targeted at adults.

Project Vision:
Our vision for this project is to create a website that's easy to understand and navigate, while also being visually appealing for the users.

Scope:
The website will include features such as buttons for navigation, dropdown boxes, text input boxes,

Dependencies:
- To start our first wireframe designs, we need some basic planning done so we have something to go off. This could be keeping the homepage simple with only a small sentence and a button. Also choosing user inputs, the theme of the page, and navigation.
- Development depends on high fidelity designs. This lets us know exactly how the website will look, with the background, text, and buttons. The reason this is dependent is because it's a lot more work to make changes in HTML than PowerPoint, so knowing what we're doing will help.
